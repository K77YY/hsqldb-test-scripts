# hsqldb-test-scripts

- tdb.script contains a database using test data.
- ConnectDatabase.java just connects to the database and runs a simple SQL query.
- NewCustomer.java connects to the database and ads a new customer to the Customer table.
- Main.java and ResSet.java are unfinished and dont really do anything. They exist for personal testing purposes only.
